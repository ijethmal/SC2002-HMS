## Hospital Management System (HMS)
Our code for hospital management system is designed to automate key hospital operations including patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, etc. 

It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture that allows a clear organisation of the code by dividing each class into 3 different files- the model, the view, and the controller. The system focuses on efficiently handling the data to ensure a smooth flowing management system for the hospital ecosystem.
The Model focuses on handling data and logic, the view handles the user interface and the controller is a link between the two. By combining these elements along with addititonal features like serialisation and deserialisation we developed a system that ensures modularity, is easy to scale, and is easy to maintain all the while adhering to object-oriented programming principles to create a robust and efficient hospital management system. Error handling mechanisms have been incorporated to manage edge cases and ensure reliability during runtime. 


Our application focuses on prioritising user-friendliness and scalability. It has been designed by keeping the SOLID principle in mind, thus allowing it to adapt as per future requirements. Overall our Hospital Management System is a robust, efficient, and adpatable system that is designed to enhance user experience while ensuring the hospital ecosystem is well managed.
